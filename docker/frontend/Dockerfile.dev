# Frontend Development Stage
# ============================

# Use Node.js 20 on Alpine Linux
# This image is optimized for development:
# - Includes Node.js runtime
# - Lightweight base image
# - Suitable for running Vite dev server with hot reload
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set the working directory inside the container
# All frontend-related commands will be executed from this path
WORKDIR /app

# Copy frontend dependency definition files (package.json, package-lock.json)
# This step allows Docker to cache dependency installation
# and avoid re-installing packages on every source code change
COPY frontend/package*.json ./

# Install frontend dependencies
# Uses npm install to support development workflows
# (hot reload, optional dependency changes, etc.)
RUN npm install

# Copy the complete frontend source code into the container
# Includes Vite config, TypeScript files, assets, and components
COPY frontend .

# Start the Vite development server
# --host 0.0.0.0 allows access from outside the container
# (required when running inside Docker)
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev", "--", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
